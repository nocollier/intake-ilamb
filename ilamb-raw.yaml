    estimates of simultaneously balanced surface water and energy budget
    components over 2003-2009 that are coherent by being able to solve the water
    and energy budgets simultaneously at 0.5-degree grid scale. The individual
    budget variables, where possible (1) combine a range of existing global
    estimates, (2) are observationally constrained with in-situ observations,
    and (3) have uncertainty estimates that reflect their agreement with in-situ
    measurements."

    Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission, Envisat's ASAR instrument and JAXA's Advanced
    Land Observing Satellite (ALOS-1 and ALOS-2), along with additional

    programme by the Biomass CCI team."
